          Flour: Use all-purpose flour in this recipe. If desired, you can
          replace half of the flour with whole wheat flour for a heartier,
          denser pumpkin muffin. Baking Soda: Helps the muffins rise. There’s no
          need for baking powder and, in fact, I’ve made these pumpkin cream
          cheese muffins with only baking soda before too. (Just leave out the
          baking powder in those; truly no noticeable difference in the
          outcome.) Cinnamon, Ginger, & Pumpkin Pie Spice: Pumpkin is tasty, but
          in order to really bring out its flavor, you need some warming spices
          like cinnamon, ginger, and pumpkin pie spice. You can use store-bought
          or try my homemade pumpkin pie spice blend. Pumpkin pie spice already
          includes cinnamon and ginger, but for the BEST, deepest flavor, I
          recommend using all 3. See recipe Note. Pumpkin Puree: You need 1 and
          1/2 cups (about 340g) of pumpkin puree, which is most of a standard
          15-ounce can. Do not use pumpkin pie filling. Just like with these
          pumpkin snickerdoodles, canned pumpkin is best, but you could use
          fresh puree if that’s what you have. Oil: The muffins taste dry and
          rubbery without some fat. Just as if we’re making pumpkin cake and
          pumpkin coffee cake, use vegetable oil. You could also use melted
          coconut oil. Brown & White Sugars: Pumpkin adds a lot of volume to the
          muffin batter, but doesn’t sweeten it at all. Using half white and
          brown sugars provide enough sweetening, and the brown sugar adds
          additional flavor. Eggs: Provide structure. Milk: Like most muffin
          recipes, the batter needs a liquid. You can use whole milk,
          buttermilk, or any dairy or nondairy milk you enjoy. I use orange
          juice in my pumpkin bread recipe, but using orange juice (for the
          amount of liquid needed here) wasn’t ideal here. The muffins were too
          citrus-y. You could, of course, replace *some* of the milk with *some*
          orange juice..
