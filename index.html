          In a large bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, pumpkin pie
          spice, ginger, and salt together until combined. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a medium bowl, whisk the oil, granulated sugar, brown sugar,
          pumpkin puree, eggs, and milk together until combined. Pour the wet
          ingredients into the dry ingredients, and then fold everything
          together gently just until combined and no flour pockets remain.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spoon the batter into liners, filling them all the way to the top.
          Bake for 5 minutes at 425°F, then, keeping the muffins in the oven,
          reduce the oven temperature to 350°F (177°C). Bake for an additional
          16–17 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out
          clean. The total time these muffins take in the oven is about 21–22
          minutes, give or take. Allow the muffins to cool for 5 minutes in the
          muffin pan before enjoying.
